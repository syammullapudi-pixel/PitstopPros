          <h2>Meet Datta Mullapudi, Our Founder</h2>
          <p>Datta Mullapudi is the heart behind Pitstop Pros. An undergraduate junior studying Mechatronics Engineering at Texas A&M University, he brings over two years of professional automotive service experience from Valvoline, where he developed strong skills in diagnostics, preventative maintenance, and customer service. What started as a personal interest in understanding how machines work grew into Pitstop Pros—a mobile service built to make car maintenance more convenient, honest, and accessible for busy customers.</p>
          <p>
            Datta's technical expertise covers a wide spectrum of automotive systems. He specializes in accurately diagnosing drivability issues and performing major component replacements, including 
            cooling systems, suspension and steering, braking systems, and electrical troubleshooting. He is equipped to handle extensive mechanical repairs on-location providing the same technical quality
            as a facility-based shop with the efficiency of mobile service. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <p> Datta is committed to professional integrity, clear communication, and precise workmanship on every job.</p>
